#  Protecting M365 from on-premis attacks

* Many customers connect their private corporate networks to Microsoft 365 to benefit their users, devices, and applications. 

However, there are many well-documented ways these private networks can be compromised. 

As we have seen in recent events related to the SolarWinds compromise, on-premises compromise can propagate to the cloud. 

Because Microsoft 365 acts as the “nervous system” for many organizations, it is critical to protect it from compromised on-premises infrastructure.
